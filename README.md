# promises
In this repo, we will add demo projects for js promises.

NOTE: No extra setup required as promises are native to js.

In 'simple_promise', we show that promises emit the data once everything is ready rather than in packets like observables.

In 'simple_api_call', we are calling an api using promises. To do the api call, we are making use of fetch().

In 'promise_api_chaining', we are using the result of a first api call as parameter to the second api call. To do the chaining, then() are chained.
